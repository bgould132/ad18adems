Candidate #1
Kalimah Priforce
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes

For far too long, “we the people” have been confronted with a false choice - a vote between fascism on one side and corruption on the other. As a city councilmember for Emeryville and former tech entrepreneur based in Oakland, my hacktivism and community service comes first. It’s why I recently endured a ten-day hunger strike for an independent public ethics commission for my city and launched a neighborhood advocacy group, Emery Rising, to protect our local voices as renters, single family homeowners, workers, and small businesses. A child of Haitian immigrants, I moved to the East Bay in 2010 to make an impact on Silicon Valley by founding companies and organizations that made a difference. For many of you, I’m just the kid from Brooklyn who inspired you or your child into building apps that transform lives. For others, I’m known for making good trouble by speaking up for equity, reparations (repair), and making our communities safer. I’ve been named an Obama White House Champion of Change and awarded the Echoing Green fellowship, but being on a team with fellow changemakers is its own reward. From the shores of Alameda to the hills of Oakland, a better world is possible and I’m not alone in my fights and prayers in supporting working families against the lack of affordability and the rise of prices everywhere. Genocides and gentrification, displacement and deportation, nothing changes until our dehumanizing systems change. Be the change with us. Vote to re-elect me as your Assembly District 18 delegate to the California Democratic Party along with my Progressive Delegate Network endorsed slate. We are The People’s Slate.

Candidate #2
Nelson Tam
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes

Nelson Tam is a long-time AD-18 resident of forty years who has worked tirelessly on the election of changemaker Progressive reform candidates, campaigns, and the implementation of transformative social justice policies locally and nationally in the redress of income and wealth inequalities. With the aftermath of the 2024 elections, Tam recognizes the work ahead - that this is a turning point for an emergent and deep scope Democratic Party realignment to fulfill material improvements for our district, for our state residents -- and the elevation of community-led initiatives in national policy reach. He is proud of leading the 2025 Unifying Four Slate of fellow relentless capacity builders dedicated to salient voter engagement, legislative support, policy activism, and determined coalition organizing to the state party. Being a delegate is far from merely casting endorsement votes -- it's about driving cavalier change with preventative foresight. In a new era of Trump resistance, "block and build" organizing strategies, programmatic political alliances transcendent of normal partisan systems -- it is imperative members of the state party build year-round organizing infrastructure enhancing our Progressive policy domain, but also to boost voter plurality in crossover issue outreach activating more supporters to the state party -- particularly to the new category of the ex-urban electorate. As a first generation AAPI immigrant who was raised in Oakland, Tam has seen the exhaustive multi-generational effects of harmful structural inequalities. Providing voice for those marginalized in our electoral system and advancing AD 18 district needs requires continued action this decade for affordable housing, worker's rights, preventing austerity, expansion of elder/disabled long term-care, climate change amelioration, infrastructure investment, full fledged economic development to address public revenue losses -- fiscal accountability. In his first term as an ADEM delegate, Tam has worked on building party capacity as a communications manager on the Executive Board of the CADem Children's Caucus launching new Caucus programming helping to double caucus memberships. He has served with the California Nurses Association in multi-cycle organizing of single payer Medicare For All -- lobbying for CalCare -- and platforming a new Patient Bill of Rights.

Candidate #3
Yoana Tchoukleva
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes

I know many of us are tired. We are tired of working two or three jobs while corporations get tax cuts. We are tired of seeing our neighbors become homeless and our elders feel unsafe while our government sends billions in weapons to kill kids in Palestine, instead of investing in life-saving services here at home. We are tired of our Earth burning and billionaires going into space, instead of stopping the destruction of our planet. It is Mission Critical here on Earth and we all are the “Guardians of the Galaxy” we have been waiting for! Thank you for everything you are doing already to uplift your communities. Whether you are a teacher, activist, artist, dancer, entrepreneur or a public interest attorney like me, I am here to bring YOUR voice to the California Democratic Party. I am here to expand the decision-making table so that you have a say in the decisions that impact you. My name is Yoana Tchoukleva (she/they) (formally “Ioana”). I am an attorney, restorative justice circle keeper, and policy analyst, dedicated to realizing a future where all of our children can thrive. I was born and raised in Bulgaria in a family torn apart by domestic violence, mental illness and the intergenerational impacts of communism and colonialism. Ever since I was a child, I wanted to know how we can end violence so no other kid has to live through what I did. Moving to Oakland 13 years ago, I found a place to call home and a community to grow old with. Sitting in restorative justice circles in San Quentin and juvenile hall showed me that it is, in fact, possible to end violence! It starts with creating practices and policies that allow our most vulnerable community members to heal from trauma and meet their material needs. It starts with investment in youth leaders, violence interrupters, jobs, housing, healthcare, and education, the kinds of policies that have been shown to improve pubic safety. Over the last two years, as a first-time delegate, I did exactly what I promised to do. I wrote and advocated for a historic resolution calling for a ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza. I voted for reparations, helped lead the Progressive Delegates Network and much more. And I am willing to do it again—I am running with the AD18 People’s Slate to be your champion in our state party. Got questions or ideas? Email me at ioanaq@gmail.com. We are The People’s Slate!

Dear Voter, It is an honor to run with you and your values as your next CA ADEM Delegate. As a proud mother, a community based organizer, a member of the United Nations Association, a political and issues based consultant, and a social justice public health worker, I have served our communities for 20 years now, working on the foundational reforms that built the safety net of our region, which I intend to continue to protect by keeping us all unified.

Candidate #5
Nate Hanson
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


Nate Hanson I am running as part of the Housing and Climate Progressive Democratic Slate because I am committed to helping to make the Democratic Party work for everyday Californians. We need real solutions to the housing and homelessness crisis, comprehensive and just public safety, and meeting the needs of our most vulnerable residents, our small businesses, and our working people. I’m an affordable housing developer and advocate. I build housing throughout the Bay Area for individuals with developmental disabilities, seniors whose homes were destroyed by wildfires caused by the climate crisis, and families at risk of homelessness. My mission is to help protect and house the most vulnerable in our community. As an affordable housing developer, I know California’s housing processes are broken. I have the experience and expertise to push our leaders to make California a place where we can actually build more affordable housing and meet our community’s needs. I live in East Oakland and am a proud parent of an Oakland Unified School District student. I’m committed to a strong public school system so that every child has access to opportunity, regardless of their starting point. I am committed to protecting the rights of the LGBTQ+ and immigrant communities, combatting hateful rhetoric, and ensuring that tenants can live in safe, secure housing where they are afforded the opportunity to thrive. I will do everything I can to push California to be a symbol of justice, opportunity, and security for all of our district’s residents. The Housing & Climate Progressive Democratic Slate includes members from across our community, from organized labor leaders to affordable housing developers, anti-trafficking advocates, and educators. Our party is at an inflection point. We have a responsibility to show that California Democrats can govern and that we are committed to solutions, not posturing and process, to deliver on our values. Vote for the Housing & Climate Progressive Democratic Slate to tell the Democratic Party that it’s time to deliver on our promises!

Candidate #6
Fay Eastman
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: No


My name is Fay Eastman, and I ask you to vote for me as an elected Delegate for our Assembly District 18. I've been appointed as a CDP Delegate by State Senator Nancy Skinner, so I bring experience! In the last election, I phone banked voters and door knocked in California, Arizona and Pennsylvania to inform, persuade, organize and get out our voters. I've also trained and led volunteers in many campaign phone banks. I have worked in health care for 20 years, I’m currently in the Intensive Care Unit as a Patient Care Technician at Kaiser Oakland. Working though the pandemic has been a challenge but also a privilege. The members of my Union, SEIU-UHW, have elected me as a past and current Executive Board representative for our members in the District. I was chosen to help lead the Political Committee of our Board, which helps to build power for working-class people in California and beyond. We’ve led lobby visits with elected officials to help create laws and settle contracts which improve personal protective equipment access for all essential workers to make it easier for hospitals/clinics to retain and recruit health care workers. We fought to get COVID sick leave pay approved and obtained safe housing for essential workers who were exposed to the virus. We also won childcare funding provided for essential workers when the schools were shut down. I come from a generation of union workers. My grandparents worked union jobs and that helped them to provide stability for the family. I've helped many people in our community gain health insurance at ACA enrollment events organized by UHW. I’ve collected signatures as part of our campaigns to qualify three different state initiatives on the ballot, including the $15 minimum wage initiative which was quickly signed into law in 2016. Healthcare advocacy is a passion of mine and I will continue to fight on behalf of our community! I believe in making healthcare a right in California! Everyone deserves prompt access to quality, affordable health care. Please vote for Fay Eastman, ADEM candidate for Assembly District 18! fayeastman@gmail.com

Candidate #7
Khilynn Fowler
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


With a steadfast commitment to advancing equity and inclusion, I bring my experience as the Community Relations Manager at the San Francisco Community Health Center and a former Community Relations Manager for the City and County of San Francisco’s Office of Transgender Initiatives. My work centers on advocating for women’s rights, equal housing, economic opportunities, and access to affordable healthcare—especially in the realm of mental health. At the core of my efforts is the urgent need to restore trust, bridge divides, and foster meaningful connections between the LGBTQ community and government leaders. I am deeply honored to serve as the first transgender woman appointed Commissioner of Arts and Culture for the City of San Leandro. In this role, I championed cultural expression by ensuring that all voices were given a platform. I also spearheaded the creation of the city's first small business grant of its kind, reflecting my belief that intentional leadership drives inclusivity and economic empowerment. As the first transgender commissioner for Alameda County’s Status of Women Commission, I’ve dedicated my advocacy to advancing the rights and well-being of women on both local and global levels. Women’s rights are not merely an issue to address—they are a foundation for building a fair and just society. I continue to prioritize amplifying the voices of women from diverse backgrounds and tackling systemic barriers that disproportionately affect them. Looking forward, my focus is on rebuilding hope within our communities, restoring trust in our government officials, and revitalizing faith in the Democratic Party. I believe that through intentional leadership, we can unite diverse communities to shape a future rooted in equity, opportunity, and justice for all. Together, we can create a society where every individual—regardless of their background—has access to safe housing, affordable healthcare, and equal opportunities to thrive. Thank you for your support as we move forward on this journey of progress and inclusivity. Let's work hand in hand to ensure that every voice is heard and valued.

Sonya Allensmith
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


Hello. My name is Sonya Allen-Smith, and I am asking for your vote as a Delegate for AD 18. I was born and raised in San Francisco and have lived in Oakland as a homeowner for over 30+ years. I graduated from California State University, East Bay, with a BS in sociology and a Master's in Healthcare Administration. I have worked in healthcare as a Radiologic Technologist for over 20 years. Over the past fifteen years, I have been a Healthcare Advocate with SEIU-UHW, focused on building the healthcare workforce with community members, raising the minimum wage, expanding Medi-Cal eligibility, and working with local and State politicians to improve the health care system. I’ve also helped elect candidates endorsed by the Party by talking to voters as a volunteer in UHW’s phone bank program. My passion for wanting to serve as a Delegate for AD 18 flows out of my service work to educate and update working class people on community issues and concerns because of our volatile political climate. I also want to educate and ensure that our most vulnerable patients, like the pediatric, elderly, and critically ill patients we see every day, have better access to quality, affordable healthcare. Thank you for considering voting for me as a Delegate for our District!

Anthony Zamora
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


Let's cut to the chase: Our Democratic Party needs a swift kick of innovation, and AD18 deserves a delegate who tells it like it is. Here's the deal - while Silicon Valley billionaires are taking moon shots, too many Oakland families are struggling to make rent. That's not just wrong, it's economically stupid. Look, I'm not here to sell you a fairy tale about overnight transformation. But I am here to tell you that we can absolutely crush it if we get real about what works. The data doesn't lie: progressive policies, when implemented with brass-tacks practicality, deliver results. Period. Here's the game plan: First, we're going to attack housing affordability like a startup attacks market share - aggressively and intelligently. The American Dream shouldn't require a tech salary. Second, we're putting economic inequality in a chokehold. When the middle class thrives, everybody wins - it's not rocket science, it's Economics 101. Third, we're going to tackle climate change while creating more jobs than a Silicon Valley hiring spree. Because guess what? Green energy isn't just good for the planet - it's an economic goldmine waiting to be tapped. I'll be your advocate who combines progressive fire with practical know-how. Think of me as your political CrossFit trainer - I'll push hard for results, but I won't let us injure ourselves with impractical policies. The time for timid incrementalism is over. But so is the time for unrealistic wish lists. We need solutions that are both bold AND achievable. As your delegate, I'll fight like hell to: - Make housing affordable faster than you can say "market correction" - Create more good jobs than a Tesla factory announcement - Protect our democracy with the ferocity of a mama bear - Champion public education like our future depends on it (because it does) Here's the bottom line, folks: If you want a delegate who combines progressive passion with street-smart strategy, who can speak truth to power while building winning coalitions, and who believes in bold change that actually delivers - I'm your candidate. Remember: "You can't drain the swamp til you fix the plumbing!" Let's turn our progressive values into real-world wins. I'm asking for your vote because AD18 deserves nothing less than explosive progress powered by practical smarts. Let's get to work!

Regina Chagolla
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


My name is Regina Chagolla and I am running to be an Assembly Delegate in District 18. I will be a voice for working families, LGBTQ+ communities and communities of color. I believe we need a collective effort from District 18 to support public education for all, affordable housing and economic recovery that includes green union jobs. I taught for 17 years, seven of those years as an afterschool science release teacher in Oakland public schools through the Lawrence Hall of Science. I developed and piloted science lessons on environmental justice issues including water and air quality. I currently work at Berkeley Unified where we teach HRC Foundation Welcoming Schools lessons on gender, family, and LGBTQ+ inclusivity. I serve as the Vice President of Berkeley Federation of Teachers AFT Local 1078, AFL-CIO. I am an Emeryville Unified School District Board Trustee, an Alameda Labor Council delegate, the California Federation of Teachers VP of the TK-12 Division Council of Northern California and a CA Latino School Board Association member. In 2023, I was appointed as an Alameda County Democratic Central Committee Associate and elected as Harris-Walz delegate to the 2024 Democratic National Convention. I also Co-Chaired a Berkeley School Renewal Parcel Tax Campaign and awarded AD 18 Educator of the Year in 2024. I fight for both funding for public education and for school employee wage gap funding goals. I've testified at the 2024 CA Dems Resolutions Committee meeting to support a bill to lower the voter threshold for communities to pass local affordable housing and infrastructure bonds. I’ve also testified at the CA Public Utilities Commission for solar for renters and schools. I am running with the Housing & Climate Progressive Democratic Slate. With my recent involvement in issues that impact our district, you can count on me to always vote in favor of housing for all and putting equity at the core of action on climate change.

My name is Stewart Chen, and I am proud to announce my candidacy as a Democratic delegate for Assembly District 18 as part of the People’s Slate. I am also endorsed by the Progressive Delegates Network. I am running because I believe in the power of representation and ensuring every voice in our community is heard—especially those that have been silenced for far too long. Our district is a beacon of diversity and resilience, but these values are increasingly under threat. With democracy and justice at risk, especially in light of Trump’s reemergence, we must remain vigilant and fight for policies that support working families, immigrants, and marginalized communities. I bring over 20 years of public service experience to this role, including serving on the Alameda City Council and currently as a member of the City of Alameda Healthcare District Board. These roles have given me firsthand insight into the challenges our communities face and the importance of strong, community-focused leadership. As an advocate for the immigrant community and a champion of progressive ideals, I aim to amplify voices often overlooked in decision-making. Representation matters, and I am committed to building a people-powered movement. My campaign proudly rejects corporate donations because our democracy should prioritize people, not profits. As part of the People’s Slate, we are united in pushing for bold action on: Expanding affordable housing and protecting renters' rights. Championing immigrant rights to ensure our communities feel safe and supported. We support state and local recommendations for Black Americans reparations. Fighting for environmental justice and urgent climate action. Strengthening workers’ rights and advocating for a living wage. Advancing universal healthcare so no one is left behind. As a delegate, I will work to uphold our district’s progressive values, increase transparency, and center the voices of our community in every decision. Together, we can build a movement that uplifts everyone, leaving no one behind. This campaign is not about me—it’s about us. Our district deserves leadership unafraid to challenge the status quo, stand up to corporate greed, and push for transformative change. I humbly ask for your support to represent Assembly District 18 as your delegate. Thank you for believing in the power of the people.

Dear Residents, It is an honor to run in the election as your Assembly District 18 Delegate, thank you! Originating from Massachusetts, I was raised in Humboldt and Sonoma County in Northern CA. As an Afro-Cuban American I have been fighting for social equality my entire life. I did not have the privilege to stand by and not to fight for humanity. I am mom first, but I am also a labor activist/executive, public servant and small business owner. I am the descendent of an Afro-Cuban Refugee father and an American mother. Partnering with local non-profits such as Emery Rising and other organizations to promote social justice, equitable living/wages, excellent public services, and education for the people is my priority. We are living in an era that is popularizing division, which is eliminating the working class, affordable housing, public services and education. American citizenship is being threatened. With unity and change we can create the social equality that people deserve because the challenges that the people are facing today are astonishing. I can assure you that my fight for social change will not stop here. Unlike others whose work is based on self-interest, my commitment for social change is personal and therefore dedicated to people who need help. I stand in solidarity with the People’s Slate. Please vote for all of us because this fight is for you. We are stronger together.

Hi Neighbors, My name is Ronald Cook. For the past several years, I’ve been actively working with our political committee and local leaders, learning how politics works and how my voice and commitment can make a difference. I’ve been a frontline healthcare worker at Kaiser Permanente for 23 years, serving as a Transporter/Mobility Coach. I’ve also been a Shop Steward with SEIU-UHW for over two decades. Currently, I serve as the Elected Representative Chair at my facility and have been an Executive Board member for the past 12 years, spanning four terms. Additionally, I’m a proud member of our Political Committee. I’ve participated in numerous meetings with candidates and legislative members, attended the California Senator debate in Los Angeles, and lobbied in Sacramento for key legislation, including SB 525 (the minimum wage bill) and SB 275 (the personal protective equipment bill). I’m passionate about improving lives in our district by fighting for workers’ rights, affordable healthcare, homelessness solutions, veteran support, and addressing mental health challenges in our communities. I humbly ask for your vote as an ADEM candidate and look forward to the opportunity to serve you.

Isaac Pingree

Executive Board Candidate: Yes


My name is Isaac Pingree, and I’m running to represent fellow Democratic voters in my community—individuals and families who vote conscientiously for the only sane, rational, democracy-believing party on the ballot. I have deep roots in Alameda and Oakland. Aside from my four years at UC Santa Cruz, where I double-majored in Film and Digital Media and Politics, I have lived my entire life in this district. I’ve made a career as a self-employed video producer while remaining engaged in political issues. Today, I am a renter in Alameda, raising a toddler with my wife, who works in public school operations. We are proud to be part of this vibrant community we love, and intend to remain here for the rest of our lives. My work as a filmmaker has brought me into collaboration with a wide range of people and organizations across our region—I’ve made videos for schools, small businesses, civil rights attorneys, and scientists at Berkeley National Laboratory developing green technologies that will reshape our built environment. I’ve helped craft and tell the stories of nonprofits dedicated to issues such as cross-cultural understanding, animal welfare, preservation of traditional music, and creating opportunities for formerly incarcerated people. These experiences have given me a unique perspective on how diverse efforts contribute to moving our society forward, and a deep understanding that we all have a role to play, and must find a way to work together. Housing We must build our way out of this housing crisis with an “all of the above” approach, while advancing policies that curb predatory real estate practices and promote sustainable development. Economic Justice At the federal level, we must be a party that is not afraid to tax the egregiously wealthy. At the state and local level we need to continue to uplift programs that help close the racial wealth gap. Environment Championing renewables and reusables and promoting equitable solutions to keeping our shared spaces clean are needed to keep trash out of waterways, to fight climate change, and preserve the health of our Bay. Public Safety People in every community of our state want and deserve to feel safe. From small businesses to cyclists and pedestrians we need holistic approaches to public safety that work for everyone and in turn strengthen the character and social fabric of our neighborhoods.

Executive Board Candidate: Yes


Hi! My name is Miya Cain (she/her). I am running to be a delegate to the California Democratic Party, because our community deserves better. Right now, East Bay families are struggling with high rents, unaffordable healthcare, expensive childcare, and growing safety concerns. While wealth and power concentrate at the top, our communities' basic needs go unmet. My commitment to community service is deeply personal. Growing up in Miami, there were many times when lights or water were cut off because bills were too expensive. Fortunately, I was surrounded by love. My community of neighbors, teachers, friends, and parents shared food, helped out with money, and picked me and my sister up from school when my parents could not. I learned early on that when communities come together, we can create powerful change. For the past nine years, I’ve called Oakland home and put my commitment to community care into action in the East Bay. As a volunteer doula, I supported moms at a public hospital through painful labor. As a peer counselor at the Berkeley Free Clinic, I provided free counseling services to people without health insurance. And as a New Leaders Council fellow and board member, I facilitated a training program for the next generation of leaders committed to advancing equity and racial justice. I have also coached and organized with leaders across the country, and I was the leadership development coordinator for the Formerly Incarcerated, Convicted People & Families Movement organizing fellowship. As a political appointee for the Obama Administration at Health and Human Services, I learned the importance of ensuring affected communities are at the table to create policies. Today, I work at a non-profit where I focus on advancing mental wellbeing and health equity for marginalized communities and build collaborations across sectors that elevate community voice and leadership, including youth-led initiatives. I am also a public narrative and community organizing coach and trainer. Endorsed by the California Progressive Delegates Network, I am proud to run to bring our community voices to the state party. I commit to make sure your voice is heard and to keep fighting for policies that serve everyone, not just the wealthy few. Together, let’s transform the East Bay and California into a place where every person can thrive! We are the People’s Slate!

At this moment, we need more than just politicians– we need inspiring doers. While the Democrats have long stood for equality, justice, and opportunity, internal divisions have weakened and fragmented our party. We must embrace a more unifying vision and seek leaders who govern with integrity and principle. Only this will move the needle. As a proven community leader, parent, and small business-owner who has lived in Oakland for 24 years, I know how to drive real change. For 15 years, I have illuminated the surprising epidemic of human trafficking happening locally and throughout California. This involved exposing weaknesses in public safety and ineffective social support systems. I've created and produced statewide education campaigns to prevent abuse and support survivors. In parallel, I championed key legislation and policy advancements. As the founder of Abolitionist Mom and OnPurpose Creative, I’ve successfully partnered with public officials to launch awareness campaigns that reached over 20 million viewers, reshaping the narrative on sex trafficking. With California Against Slavery, I co-initiated SB1165, making California the first state to mandate sexual abuse and sex trafficking prevention education in schools. I also co-founded Oakland’s Commercially Sexually Exploited Children’s Task Force, and served as Prevention Education Chair for AC United, and an advisor to the Youth Advisory Board on Homelessness. My efforts have been recognized with the Modern Day Abolitionist Award for Advocacy as well as the Ford Unsung Hero Award. My education includes a BS in Business from SDSU and an MA in Communication from University of Texas at Austin. As your Assembly District Delegate, I will be committed to bold, transformative policies that promote well-being, ensure public safety, defend fundamental rights, and protect our planet. A strong, just economy is the foundation for better jobs, affordable healthcare, quality schools, and safer, thriving communities where everyone’s basic needs are met. I’m dedicated to advancing our party’s values and supporting courageous leaders prepared to confront our most urgent challenges. Together, we can build a stronger, more equitable future. I would be honored to earn your vote. For information, contact genice.jacobs@gmail.com

I am running for ADEMs as part of the Progressive Delegate Network (PDN). I am a 31 year-old UAW member, first generation college graduate, and born-and-raised Californian. I have dedicated the last decade of my life to building the labor movement. The 2024 election highlighted the dangers of the democratic party shifting toward the right rather than embracing progressive values. Young and working class voters were isolated by the party’s inaction to end the war in Gaza and were not given an inspiring vision of economic justice to which they could look forward. We must grow our party and its power by recommitting to healthcare for all, reproductive rights, education, affordable housing, immigrant rights, racial justice, peace over war, and progressive taxation. My academic background is in Earth and Planetary Science. As we saw during the devastating LA fires, climate change is exacerbating disasters, and the pace of political action is not meeting the moment. I work in the political and policy spheres with environmental, labor, and grassroots organizations to decarbonize rapidly and empower workers and frontline communities to lead the climate movement by ensuring all projects are built with union labor, manufacturing workers have a free and fair chance to unionize, and we win enforceable community benefits. As the previous Vice President of UAW 4811, the union of academic workers at University of California, I led the 2022 contract campaign and 48,000 worker strike, resulting in unprecedented wage and benefit increases and anti-abusive conduct policies that were extended to all employees at UC– CA’s largest public employer. I worked to democratize our union, because more engagement builds power. As an elected delegate to the DNC, having experienced state and national party dynamics, I seek to improve our internal processes so that democrats feel ownership over their party. As an Alameda Labor Council delegate, UAW leader, and DSA member, I have volunteered and turned out other volunteers for numerous local elections as well as key races across the state since I turned 18. I volunteer with Seed the Vote to mobilize CA union members to swing states to elect democrats for federal races. If you elect me as an Assembly District 18 delegate to the CA Democratic Party, I will bring my progressive practicality to the endorsement process and to our platform.

I’d like to bring a moderate Democrat voice to the Central Committee, especially after the trends we saw in the 2024 election. I’m a career software engineer (currently at Google), who’s been active in my local community. The 2016 election motivated me to find ways to contribute to strengthening our democracy. I joined the League of Women Voters to support various democracy initiatives. As part of the Leadership Alameda Class of 2025, I’m currently taking a deep dive into Alameda government, business, culture, public works, and public safety. In 2022 I ran my campaign to join the Alameda City Council. In 2024 I worked in two elections as a poll worker at the South Shore Mall. Talking face to face with Alameda voters was a valuable experience, and one thing I learned is that the single highest expectation for local government is public safety. If voters have the perception that they can’t shop, walk in their neighborhoods, or park their cars safely, almost nothing else matters. Democrats need to be the party of responsible public safety. As the party in power in California, it’s critical that Democrats execute well at running the government and supporting all Californians. We need to show voters that the government is meeting their needs. I’ve been an effective leader both in my work and on nonprofit boards. I’ve specialized in fiscal responsibility and am currently the treasurer for multiple organizations. The unique location and exemplary people resources in this county put us in a position to emphasize and champion infrastructure and climate resiliency. Sea level rise and storm surge adaptation is especially important for our bay-side district, including home, parks and businesses. I’ve contributed to raising awareness and problem solving with multiple organizations since working with the Alameda Magazine on a sea level rise cover article in 2017. I’m excited to represent you to improve the Democratic party, our democracy, and our government. Please connect with me at paulb4alameda@gmail.com.

Allyssa Victory is running for re-election to represent YOU! Allyssa was first elected as an ADEM delegate in 2021. In 2023, she won re-election with the entire People’s slate and was the highest vote-getter earning a place on the CA Democratic Party’s Executive Board. Allyssa helped launch the #electBlackADEMs campaign in 2021 to bring attention to the lack of Black Delegates and the candidates running statewide. In her democratic roles, Allyssa has organized for workers’ rights, ceasefire, reparations, criminal justice, increased democracy, and more! Every resolution Allyssa has authored has been adopted by the Alameda County Democratic Central Committee.
Allyssa is a trailblazing civil rights leader, educator, and licensed attorney raised in Oakland. Allyssa has devoted her entire career to advocacy on behalf of the public interest and underserved communities. Allyssa holds a B.A. with Honors in Ethnic Studies and minor in Black Studies from UC San Diego as well as J.D. concentrated in Government Law from UC Law SF (formerly Hastings). Allyssa spent her first 4 years of practice in workers’ rights for statewide organizations, non-profits, individual workers, and representing unions. Allyssa has since transitioned her legal career to criminal justice focused on protecting civil rights and liberties while advancing public safety.
Allyssa ran an historic and grassroots campaign for Mayor of Oakland in 2022 and continues to lead civic engagement focused on enfranchising formerly incarcerated residents and youth voters. Allyssa was awarded the Kick Ass Youth award by the East Bay Young Democrats in 2022.
Allyssa is endorsed by the California Progressive Delegates Network and is proud to run with the People’s Slate to bring community voice to our state party.

I’m running with the Housing & Climate Progressive Democratic Slate because we need real change in the California Democratic Party. For too long, our leaders have focused on symbolism over substance and process over progress. In doing so, we’ve fallen short of our progressive goals. Instead of affordable housing, we have record housing costs; instead of slowing climate change, we have raging wildfires; and instead of good jobs, we have empty storefronts. We can do better. I’ve been a local organizer and activist for the past ten years, fighting to address the basic problems that our governments have failed to handle. In 2024, while living in Oakland, I authored and organized the winning campaign for Berkeley’s Measure FF - a citizen’s initiative that will invest over $250 million in fixing Berkeley’s streets and making them safer for families walking and biking. Berkeley’s elected leaders neglected their streets for decades, and when they finally asked the voters for funding in 2022, they lost. I stepped up and made it happen when the City Council couldn’t. That’s the kind of leadership and focus on basic government services that we need, and that I will bring to the Democratic Party. It’s a focus I’ve developed and honed over the past five years running my own small business, working as a policy consultant on climate change issues for cities like New York, London, and Toronto. Governments and businesses are different in many ways, but one similarity is that in either case, you need the basic services and functions to be running smoothly in order to have capacity for innovation and progress. The Democratic Party has neglected those basic services, and now we won’t be able to achieve the progress we had hoped for. In order to protect immigrants, women, and the LGBTQ community, we need to ensure people can afford to live here. In order to tackle racial equity issues, we need to ensure low-income neighborhoods aren’t plagued by gunfire. In order to create good jobs, we need businesses to open up and expand locally. As your AD-18 Delegate, I’ll fight for the Democratic Party to deliver the basics of good government so we can advance our progressive goals. Vote for the Housing & Climate Progressive Democratic Slate to tell the Democratic Party: it’s time for real progress! Contact: ben@bengould.org

I am running as part of the Housing and Climate Progressive Democratic Slate because I am committed to fighting our housing crisis, protecting our vulnerable communities, and making sure our Democratic leadership stays focused on outcomes over process. I have a deep background in housing and transportation advocacy and have membership in multiple pro-housing and environmental groups. My work is driven by a need to reform the structural barriers in our society that disproportionately affect those that are underrepresented in government. I also served on Emeryville’s Bicycle/Pedestrian Advisory Committee where I helped develop objective standards to streamline housing construction and advocated for safe streets that can be used by those of all ages and abilities. I am strongly committed to Vision Zero and believe we should not accept any more lives being lost to traffic violence. In the era of Trump, the last thing we should be doing as a state is displacing our most vulnerable residents with crushing housing costs. This means supporting the construction of new housing for all income levels and protecting our tenants. My home city of Emeryville is the only city in the Bay Area to increase its Black population by focusing on implementation of data driven solutions to our housing crisis. We have proven strategies for fighting displacement and fighting the housing crisis, we must hold our Democratic leadership accountable to implement them. We must also be a state where our LGBTQ community and immigrants don’t have to fear how they might be stripped of their rights. Beyond that, we should be welcoming to those across the country that may be threatened by the new hostile administration. California should be the example for how Democratic leadership can stand against hate. Vote for the Housing & Climate Progressive Democratic Slate if you believe in holding our Democratic Party accountable towards achieving real, tangible progress.

I’m a former teacher and parent activist who served on the Oakland School Board from 2021-25, now running for ADEM on the Housing and Climate Progressive Democratic Slate to fight strategically for our values in the daunting era of Trump 2.0. I have four priorities as a delegate. First, on the School Board I promoted building affordable and workforce housing on unused district land. There is so much vacant public property causing blight in our community. I have the experience to create policy to accelerate repurposing these empty sites to house those who are struggling to stay in California. Second, we must stand with our immigrant community to fight Trump’s deportation campaign. In 2018, I joined those leading the Let Our People Go protests at the Richmond jail, causing the county to end its contract with ICE. My mom’s family fled the Nazis in 1939, so I know what this country can represent in its better moments. We can build a powerful coalition rooted in faith and real family values—families in all their beautiful forms—that rejects hate, racism and xenophobia. Third, I will continue my education work. In 2022, I led the Measure H campaign to renew College and Career for All in the Oakland high schools, which passed with an 81% yes vote. I also stood with our teens to win implementation of Oakland Youth Vote in 2024. As a parent, I have learned so much about our teens’ experience of the gender spectrum. While I use he/him pronouns myself, we must support each person’s right to choose how to identify, including at schools and on sports teams. It’s sickening that Republicans target our trans youth as a wedge issue. Fourth, my School Board experience taught me that good stewardship of public dollars is a progressive, not a conservative, value. One of my proudest achievements was allocating OUSD bond funds equitably to renovate four schools in the flatlands where promises were broken by prior administrations. Our system sets up elected leaders to be in conflict with labor, but I always worked to restore those relationships. Labor is an essential partner in good governance. I was an ADEM delegate in 2019-20, and humbly ask that you vote for me to return. I currently work for UC on a project tracking the eligibility of students from across California for CSU and UC admission. I have a BA from UC Berkeley and an MS from Cal State East Bay, both in Math.

I’m a LGBTQ+ woman, partner, and parent of an OUSD student, deeply committed to the values of fairness, inclusion, and progress. With over 15 years of experience in policy and government, I’ve seen firsthand the transformative power of good governance—a government that listens, acts with integrity, and creates policies that have a real and lasting impact. I am running for delegate with the Housing and Climate Progressive Democratic Slate to continue this effort within the California Democratic Party platform. I love Oakland- after going to college in the East Bay, it was Oakland that felt like home. After starting my policy career in Washington, DC, I knew I wanted to return to Oakland to raise my family. After a decade away, I found a lot had changed: rising temperatures, wildfires and air quality, skyrocketing housing costs, traffic congestion, increasing inequality gaps. The heart and the spirit of the city, however, remains and is what keeps my family- and so many others- here and fighting to keep the culture, the small businesses, the neighborhoods surviving and growing. That’s why I serve on the Oakland Advisory Board for SPUR, an urban planning policy organization, and on the policy board for Jewish Vocational Services, a bay area non-profit creating best in class workforce development training programs. My focus is on enacting policies that meaningfully and measurably improve the lives of the people in our communities. By advancing pragmatic and consequential policies that touch our daily existence—housing stability, job opportunities, and (economically, physically, and psychologically) safe communities—we can create a future where every person has the chance to thrive. My priorities include affordable housing, public education, sustainable and equitable transportation, mobility, and transit systems, public safety, and protecting vulnerable and marginalized communities. I’m running to bring people together, to put the needs of our communities first, and to enact policies that will make a real difference.

I am an advocate, communications strategist, and labor leader. I am excited to be running as a member of the People’s Slate, endorsed by the Progressive Delegate Network (PDN). As an American with migrant roots, I have never taken my right to vote, or run, for granted. I have spent over a decade working on elections and policy, from being a grassroots organizer, to advocating for voter rights and pushing forward legislation that supports bringing true safety to all of our communities. I have decided to run because I've seen how our Democratic System is in crisis. I aim to speak out and stand up to corporate interests who have manipulated our electoral process for too long. I know that true power lies with the people, and true change comes when we invest in the working class. I have lived a life of service and look forward to bringing my experiences to the state party. I am a rank and file member of CWA Local 9415 and serve on the Board as Contractual Vice President. I also serve as the Communications Manager at the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, where I have advocated for Alameda County residents for 7+ years. I’ve worked in the halls of the Capitol in Washington DC under Senator Feinstein. My entire career I have worked with and supported people who are at the margins. I have seen how real solutions come when we put aside greed and start working together to build a future that takes us all into account. I was raised in rural Northern California where the risk of wildfires was a regular part of life, but the amount of destruction our state, and the world, is facing is unprecedented and unnatural. It is time that we put human life and mother earth first. Profits will not stop climate disaster, make our streets safe, or bring the healing and peace we so desperately need. Real public safety comes when we start addressing the real issues behind crime—poverty, mental health, lack of opportunities, and reinvest into proven solutions. The steps that the Democratic Party and our country's leaders continue to take are not working. It is time that we start envisioning a new future and start putting together solutions to address the problems of today. We need all of us. I humbly ask for your vote. We are the People’s Party!

My name is Zac Bowling, and I’m running to be your delegate in AD 18 to push the party forward. I’m a lifelong Democrat, progressive, union organizer, and grassroots activist focused on affordable housing, equity, and sustainable communities. I also serve on the City of Alameda’s Open Government Commission, ensuring transparency and accountability in local government, and on the Sierra Club SF Bay Chapter’s NAC Housing Committee, advocating for environmentally sustainable housing solutions. For the past four years, I’ve represented AD 18 as a delegate, working to make affordable housing a top priority for California Democrats. Housing is foundational to fighting poverty, addressing homelessness, achieving equity, and tackling climate change. I co-founded East Bay YIMBY and have spent over a decade advocating for renters, housing affordability, and ending homelessness. We can't deny that our challenges have grown since we lost the White House and Congress. Trump’s return to power has made it clear: we need to organize better, listen to those who feel unheard, and rebuild trust in Democratic leadership. Together, we must stop Trump’s agenda, protect democracy, and create a bold vision that wins in 2026. I support safe, healthy communities for all. This means prioritizing resources for housing, mental health, and crisis prevention while addressing community concerns about crime and safety. Beyond advocacy, I’ve led efforts to make progressive causes accessible and engaging. As a digital organizer, I’ve built platforms that educate and inspire, including a growing audience of 140,000 subscribers on TikTok and YouTube, where I focus on housing and urbanism issues. Locally, I’ve helped push for legislation on housing, public transit, tenant rights, climate change, and fair wages. As your delegate, I’ll continue to champion affordable housing, better transit, and climate-resilient cities while ensuring AD 18 has a strong voice in the party. I’ll continue to work to rebuild trust in our party by engaging voters, supporting progressive candidates, and amplifying grassroots organizing in the party. I’m proud to be part of the Housing & Climate Progressive Democratic Slate, and I hope I can count on your vote. Together, we can fight for a stronger, more inclusive Democratic Party. zac@zacbowling.com

My name is Bobbi Lopez, and I am running for ADEM to bring bold, compassionate, and effective leadership to the Democratic Party. I am a public servant, policy analyst, immigrant, a mom, and a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Having immigrated to the U.S. as a child after a natural disaster, I am committed to ensuring that displaced people and those affected by climate change have a voice in shaping policies. For six years, I served as an elected member of the Central Committee, where I was also elected to the board by my peers and appointed to the legislative committee by state leaders. I later led the political program for Oakland, Emeryville, and Alameda, helping secure key victories in nearly all of our races. I am stepping forward again because we need a strong, inclusive, and pro-working-family Democratic Party to meet the challenges ahead, including winning back the White House. My Public Service Work: - Public Safety: As part of San Francisco’s Mayor’s Public Safety team, I helped reduce violent crime by 14% and property crime by 31% by focusing on prevention, community collaboration, and victim support. - Union Advocacy: As a union representative with SEIU 1021, I fought for fair treatment and better working conditions for East Bay workers. - Tenant and Immigrant Rights: At La Voz Latina, I spent five years advocating for housing & immigrant protections. - Advocacy for Children with Disabilities: I supported families during IEP and Section 504 hearings. -Policy Work: Over eight years as a legislative director and policy analyst, I helped craft key ordinances, including prevailing wage laws. My Vision 1. Defending Vulnerable Communities: I will protect LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and working families from ongoing threats to their rights. 2. Housing, Transportation, and Climate Justice: I will support more housing, more affordable housing, improve public transit, and push for bold action on climate change. 3. Community-Centered Public Safety: Public safety must include investing in youth, combating hate, and building trust through collaboration and prevention. 4. Pro-Labor Values: I stand with unions. 5. Essential Government Services: I will work for functional governments that provide vital services. This is a critical time for our nation. I humbly ask for your vote and support.

Candidate #37
Tracy Jensen
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


My name is Tracy Jensen, and I am proudto be a Democratic Alameda City Councilmember. These lessons guided me as an advisor in the Department of Health and Human Services during the Clinton Administration. I leaned on my experience in Alameda County when I worked to expand the Children’s Health Insurance Program while working for Vice President Gore. At a 2016 rally President Barack Obama said, “Democracy isn’t a spectator sport.” That sentiment resonates deeply with me. I am running to represent AD18 on the Alameda County Democratic Central Committee because I have never been a spectator and I believe that government works best when voters, advocates, and legislative leaders collaborate to support our communities. I have fought tirelessly for Democratic ideals. As a policy advisor during the Clinton Administration, I helped develop universal healthcare initiatives. As a member of the Alameda School Board, I led efforts to create the nation’s first policy ensuring safe, inclusive environments for LGBTQIA+ students, staff and families. As a city councilmember, I have worked to expand housing options for vulnerable families and ensure comprehensive services for all Alameda residents. In 2022, when I sent postcards to Georgia voters, real change happened. That success showed the impact of coordinated action at the local, state, and national levels. However, in 2024, our grassroots outreach faced challenges. While many local Democratic candidates prevailed, we struggled to persuade enough voters to prioritize progressive values over economic concerns. Even in deep-blue Alameda County, people are leaving the Democratic Party—not because they support Republican ideas, but because they feel Democrats aren’t addressing their needs. As a member of the Alameda County Democratic Central Committee, I will leverage my experience in building partnerships to reengage our community. The Central Committee must lead by supporting Democratic priorities and serving as a resource for all Alameda County voters, regardless of party affiliation. As Democrats we can support crime victims while promoting restorative justice. We can balance the needs of renters and landlords. We can harness both public and private investment to benefit the entire community. Reach me at TracyJensenAlameda@gmail.com to share your thoughts, issues, concerns and questions.

Candidate #38
Shawn Danino
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


I use they/them pronouns, and I come with over a decade of experience advocating for environmental justice, affordable housing, and safe, walkable streets. I am a dues-paying union member, a renter, a child of immigrants, and a civil servant. As someone with lived experience around homelessness, I know firsthand that homelessness is a policy choice, and I believe it is the wrong one to be making. I spent the last five years at the State Housing Department, where I planned for over a quarter million homes across California. As part of this work, I founded a $100 million grant program to finance affordable backyard homes, got the Rockridge neighborhood desegregated to accommodate an additional 5,000 mixed-income homes, and launched the Prohousing Designation program. As a civil servant, I have deep expertise in helping our cities deliver core government services quickly and efficiently, including safe streets, working fire hydrants, trash collection, and so many more issues. I ran a deeply prohousing, pro-mobility platform for Oakland City Council At-Large that centers climate change and affordability, above all - earning nearly 12,000 votes and helping Councilmember Rowena Brown secure a victory through a ranked-choice voting alliance. I proposed a zero displacement housing program that ensures no tenants or residents get displaced, while also making room for significantly more homes. I currently serve on the Board of TransForm and Transport Oakland and on the Executive Committee of the Sierra Club’s SF Bay Chapter, where I advocate for safe streets and environmental justice. As your AD-18 delegate, I will: - Prioritize tenants rights, housing abundance, and making homelessness an issue of the past. - Treat the climate crisis like a crisis, centering clean energy, mobility freedom, and clean air. - Use my half decade of public sector experience to ensure we have transparent good governance. - Pursue policies that lower the cost of living in the Bay area, making our communities more walkable and human-scale. - Protect the rights of LGBTQIA+ populations as well as the immigrant community, both of which are part of my identity. I’m proud to be part of the Housing & Climate Progressive Democratic Slate. Together, we can fight for a Democratic Party that centers housing, mobility, and climate justice. shawn.danino@gmail.com

Candidate #41
Arielle Fleisher
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: No


I'm running to be your AD 18 delegate with the Housing & Climate Progressive Democratic Slate to make our communities safer, healthier, and more equitable. As a transportation strategist, public health expert, and mother, I've seen how our current leadership has prioritized ideology over outcomes, while basic needs go unmet. It’s time for a change. Too many of our communities have been left behind by transportation decisions, facing both unsafe streets and limited access to affordable transit options. I'll champion Vision Zero policies to ensure no one dies or is seriously injured simply for walking or biking on our streets, while fighting to expand access to sustainable transportation for all, particularly in long-neglected communities. We deserve transportation systems that work for working families and people of all ages and abilities. My professional expertise in transportation policy and urban planning has shown me how Democratic values translate into real change at the local level. Through my work at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, SPUR, and Transport Oakland, I've helped improve Bay Area transportation. My advocacy has delivered concrete results: streamlining fares across transit systems, improving signage at stations, and advocating for upgraded streets that are safer for everyone. I'm not just a transportation advocate - I'm a community organizer who believes in the power of bringing people together. When new mothers were isolated during the pandemic, I founded the Pandemic Mom's Club, building it from a small support group into a thriving community resource. We brought moms together to share struggles, support each other, and build community resilience. I’m also on the leadership team for my neighborhood council, helping to organize residents and build a stronger community. These experiences have reinforced my belief that grassroots organizing, community building, and effective governance go hand in hand. As your ADEM delegate, I will: - Fight for good transit and safe, accessible streets - Center the voices of vulnerable and under-represented residents - Champion working families’ needs - from affordable housing to universal healthcare to public safety The Democratic Party must be a force for real progress. With your vote, I'll bring my expertise and commitment to help build a California that truly reflects our values.
